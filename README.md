# bootstrap-percolation

This repository is the home of the code which both acts as the back-end to
[Booper](https://github.com/thaumavorio/booper) and provided the team behind
the MQP [Studying and Visualizing Contagion on
Graphs](https://thaumavor.io/doc/bootstrap-percolation/bootstrap-percolation-mqp.pdf)
the codebase with which we built our empirical evaluation.
